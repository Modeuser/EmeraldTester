VR game where players constantly forge new and unique weapon for each unique enemy they encounter

- Once a weapon has been used, it immediately brakes
- The quality of the weapon is dependent on the forging process
- Players make weapons by moving their hands away from each other in VR
  - To make a blade, players must form a curve with their hand while remaining steady, and at a constant speed
  - to make a spear, players must form a line while moving slowly at the start, quickly at the end
  - to make a hammer, players must form a line while moving quickly at the start, slowly at the end

The Philosophy behind the design
- This design is my attempt to overcome some of the issues of feedback in melee VR titles, or rather, the lack of feedback.
  In many VR titles where you wield a melee weapon, swinging it against a enemy often feels awkward due to the lack of physical feedback when the weapon makes contact with the enemy. And there's this dissonance between the player's real life hands and the weapon in VR, when the weapon has to collide with in game objects.
  


Techniques applied in this project:
- Procedural mesh generation
  - For the weapon forging process
- Procedural animation
  - For the dynamic enemy reaction
- Motion statistical analysis
  - For analyzing unique hand gestures that aren't regularly performed in VR
