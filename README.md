VR game where players constantly forge new and unique weapon for each unique enemy they encounter

- Once a weapon has been used, it immediately brakes
- The quality of the weapon is dependent on the forging process
- Players make weapons by moving their hands away from each other in VR
  - To make a blade, players must form a curve with their hand while remaining steady, and at a constant speed
  - to make a spear, players must form a line while moving slowly at the start, quickly at the end
  - to make a hammer, players must form a line while moving quickly at the start, slowly at the end





Techniques applied in this project:
- Procedural mesh generation
  - For the weapon forging process
- Procedural animation
  - For the dynamic enemy reaction
- Motion statistical analysis
  - For analyzing unique hand gestures that aren't regularly performed in VR
